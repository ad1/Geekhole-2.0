Geekhole 2.0
============

Purpose
-------
This is the soon-to-be-used Wordpress Theme for the "notorious" www.geekhole.ch blog.
You can fork this theme if you wish, but I would not recommend it as the code is not THAT beautiful (See, it's worpress..) 

Branching
---------
Obviously on the production system **master** is checked out. Perhaps there will be a **stage** branch which is checked
out on the stage environment. All new features must be developed in a new branch, so the workflow will look something
like this:

`feature-branch > stage-branch > master`
